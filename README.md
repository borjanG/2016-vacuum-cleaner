# IA-Vacuum

The agent, a vacuum cleaner, evolves in a 2d grid that also contains several other objects (some of which may be moved or hoovered up). 

Three types of vacuum cleaners are developped here: 
* one which behaves randomly, 
* one which has sensors and behaves according to a set of rules defined a priori, and may learn new rules, 
* and one whose set of rules is given by a genetic algorithm.
